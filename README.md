So when I received my my gpd win4 2023, It had a sdcard in the reader. On that card was a bios update to 0.58 tho the official website only has up to 0.56. It was not currently installed so I installed it, alt f5 +reboot opens the bios options up like it should and all seems to be well.


BE CAREFULE BOTH THIS VERSION AND THE ONE BEFORE IT ENABLE EXTRA SECURITY. 

Updates hafta be via capsule/recovery and flashing older firmwares no longer allowed, you have been warned.
